# pingpy

a *really* simple program to ping various hosts based on a txt file

to make it work, simply add hosts or IPs on the hosts.txt file in the directory (one address per line)

Not only you're able to ping based on the txt file, but you'll also be able to open and edit the text file directly through the application.

Commands:

-h: shows command list  
-r: print hosts.txt content  
-o: open hosts.txt file with your preferred text editor  
-p: run ping
-s: exit
